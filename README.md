# sfr_assignAttr
evolving python script for maya to manage attributes on shape (for rman and arnold for now)

I'm just storing here the scripts I'm using the most, that are not involved in any pipeline of any company; just personal storing and editing content that I can have stored in here and access when I need. As well, implementing it with any opensource code I can find. If you dare to go through my nasty coding and you want to try to use it, feel free to grab it.
